# Telco-Churn


Telco churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. It shows which customers have left, stayed or signed up for their service.

In this project, data preparation and analysis, a/b test hypothesis, hypothesis testing, and modeling with a random forst classifier were carried out.
